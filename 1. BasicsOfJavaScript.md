Basics of JavaScript

**Question: Can you explain the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const` in JavaScript?**

Certainly! In JavaScript, `var`, `let`, and `const` are used to declare variables, but they have key differences in terms of scope, hoisting, and mutability.

### 1. **`var`**:
   - **Scope**: `var` is function-scoped, meaning it is accessible throughout the function in which it is declared. It does not respect block-level scope (e.g., inside an `if` or `for` block).
   - **Hoisting**: Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their scope. However, they are initialized with `undefined`, so accessing them before their declaration wonâ€™t throw an error, but you'll get `undefined`.
   - **Re-declaration**: You can re-declare a `var` variable within the same scope without errors.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     function testVar() {
         console.log(x); // undefined (due to hoisting)
         var x = 10;
         if (true) {
             var x = 20;
             console.log(x); // 20
         }
         console.log(x); // 20 (no block scope)
     }
     ```

### 2. **`let`**:
   - **Scope**: `let` is block-scoped, meaning it is only accessible within the block it is declared in (e.g., within `{}` of an `if` statement or loop).
   - **Hoisting**: `let` is hoisted, but unlike `var`, it is not initialized until the line of code where it is declared. Accessing a `let` variable before its declaration will result in a `ReferenceError` due to the "temporal dead zone."
   - **Re-declaration**: `let` cannot be re-declared in the same scope, which helps avoid accidental overwrites.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     function testLet() {
         // console.log(y); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
         let y = 10;
         if (true) {
             let y = 20;
             console.log(y); // 20 (block scope)
         }
         console.log(y); // 10 (outer scope)
     }
     ```

### 3. **`const`**:
   - **Scope**: Like `let`, `const` is block-scoped.
   - **Hoisting**: `const` is also hoisted but behaves the same way as `let` with respect to the temporal dead zone.
   - **Re-declaration and Assignment**: `const` variables cannot be re-declared or reassigned. Once assigned, their value remains constant. However, for objects and arrays, you can still modify the contents (e.g., adding or removing properties or elements).
   - **Mutability**: `const` ensures that the variable binding cannot be changed, but the value inside an object or array can still be modified.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     const z = 30;
     // z = 40; // Error: Assignment to constant variable.
     const obj = { name: 'John' };
     obj.name = 'Jane'; // Allowed, because the object itself is not immutable
     console.log(obj.name); // Jane
     ```

### Summary:
- Use `var` sparingly due to its function-scoping behavior and potential for bugs.
- Use `let` when you need to reassign a variable or want block-scoping.
- Use `const` by default for variables that should not be reassigned.

This distinction helps in writing cleaner, more predictable code.
Question: can you explain the difference between var, let and const in JavaScript
Answer: In JavaScript, var, let and const are used to declare variables, but they have key difference in terms of scope, hoisting and mutability. 
1. var: 
    Scope: var is a function scoped, meaning it is accessible throughout the function in which it is declared. It does not respect block level scope (e.g. inside an if or for block).
    Hoisting: Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope. However, they are initialized with undefined, so accessing them before their declaration won't throw an error, but you will get undefined. 
    Re-declaration; You can re-declare a var variable within the same scope without errors. 

    Example: 
        function test() {
            console.log(x); // undefined (due to hoisting)
            var x = 10;
            if (true) {
                var x = 20;
                console.log(x); // 20
            }
            console.log(x); // 20 (no block scope)
        }

2. let: 
    Scope: let is block-scoped, meaning it is only accessible within the block it is declared in (e.g., within {} of an if statement or loop)
    Hosisting: let is hoisted, but unlike var, it is not initialized untill the line of code where it is declared. Accessing a let variable before its declaration will result in a ReferenceError due to the "temporal dead zone."
    Re-declaration: let cannot be re-declared in the same scope, which helps avoid accidental overwrites.
    Example: 
        function testLet() {
            // console.log(y); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
            let y = 10;
            if (true) {
                let y = 20;
                console.log(y); // 20 (block scope)
            }
            console.log(y); // 10 (outer scope)
        }

3. const: 
    Scope: Like let, const is block scoped.
    Hoisting: const is also hoisted but behaves the smae way as let with respect to the temporal dead zone.Accessing
    Re-declaration and Assignment: const variables connot be re-declared or reassigned. Once assigned, their value remains constant. However, for objects and arrays, you can still modify the contents (e.g., adding or removing properties or elements)
    Mutability: const ensures that the variable binding can not be changed, but the value inside and object or array can still be modified. 
    Example: 
        const z = 30;
        // z = 40 // Error: Assignment to constant variable.
        const obj = {name: 'John'};
        obj.name = 'Jane'; // Allowed, because the object itself is not immutable
        console.log(obj.name) //Jane

Summary: 
    Use var sparingly due to is function scoping behaviour and potential for bugs.
    Use let when you need to reassign a variable or want block scoping.
    Use const by default for variables that should not be reassigned.
