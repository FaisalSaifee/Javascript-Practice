Basics of JavaScript

**Question: Can you explain the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const` in JavaScript?**

Certainly! In JavaScript, `var`, `let`, and `const` are used to declare variables, but they have key differences in terms of scope, hoisting, and mutability.

### 1. **`var`**:
   - **Scope**: `var` is function-scoped, meaning it is accessible throughout the function in which it is declared. It does not respect block-level scope (e.g., inside an `if` or `for` block).
   - **Hoisting**: Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their scope. However, they are initialized with `undefined`, so accessing them before their declaration won’t throw an error, but you'll get `undefined`.
   - **Re-declaration**: You can re-declare a `var` variable within the same scope without errors.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     function testVar() {
         console.log(x); // undefined (due to hoisting)
         var x = 10;
         if (true) {
             var x = 20;
             console.log(x); // 20
         }
         console.log(x); // 20 (no block scope)
     }
     ```

### 2. **`let`**:
   - **Scope**: `let` is block-scoped, meaning it is only accessible within the block it is declared in (e.g., within `{}` of an `if` statement or loop).
   - **Hoisting**: `let` is hoisted, but unlike `var`, it is not initialized until the line of code where it is declared. Accessing a `let` variable before its declaration will result in a `ReferenceError` due to the "temporal dead zone."
   - **Re-declaration**: `let` cannot be re-declared in the same scope, which helps avoid accidental overwrites.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     function testLet() {
         // console.log(y); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
         let y = 10;
         if (true) {
             let y = 20;
             console.log(y); // 20 (block scope)
         }
         console.log(y); // 10 (outer scope)
     }
     ```

### 3. **`const`**:
   - **Scope**: Like `let`, `const` is block-scoped.
   - **Hoisting**: `const` is also hoisted but behaves the same way as `let` with respect to the temporal dead zone.
   - **Re-declaration and Assignment**: `const` variables cannot be re-declared or reassigned. Once assigned, their value remains constant. However, for objects and arrays, you can still modify the contents (e.g., adding or removing properties or elements).
   - **Mutability**: `const` ensures that the variable binding cannot be changed, but the value inside an object or array can still be modified.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     const z = 30;
     // z = 40; // Error: Assignment to constant variable.
     const obj = { name: 'John' };
     obj.name = 'Jane'; // Allowed, because the object itself is not immutable
     console.log(obj.name); // Jane
     ```

### Summary:
- Use `var` sparingly due to its function-scoping behavior and potential for bugs.
- Use `let` when you need to reassign a variable or want block-scoping.
- Use `const` by default for variables that should not be reassigned.

This distinction helps in writing cleaner, more predictable code.

**Question: Can you explain the different data types in JavaScript, such as strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects?**

Absolutely! JavaScript has several fundamental data types, which can be categorized into two groups: **primitive data types** and **reference data types**. Here’s a breakdown:

### 1. **Primitive Data Types**
   Primitive types are the most basic data types. They are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once created.

   #### a. **String**
   - A sequence of characters used to represent text.
   - Strings are immutable, meaning you cannot change individual characters in a string.
   - Can be enclosed in single quotes, double quotes, or backticks (for template literals).
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     let name = "John";
     let greeting = 'Hello';
     let template = `Hi, ${name}!`; // Template literal with interpolation
     console.log(template); // Output: Hi, John!
     ```
   
   #### b. **Number**
   - Represents both integers and floating-point numbers.
   - In JavaScript, there's only one `Number` type, and it includes values like `NaN` (Not a Number) and `Infinity`.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     let age = 25;        // Integer
     let pi = 3.14;       // Float
     let notANumber = NaN; // Special value
     let infinite = Infinity;
     ```
   
   #### c. **Boolean**
   - Represents a logical entity and can have only two values: `true` or `false`.
   - Used mainly in conditional testing.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     let isActive = true;
     let isComplete = false;
     ```

   #### d. **Undefined**
   - A variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value automatically gets the value `undefined`.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     let x;
     console.log(x); // Output: undefined
     ```

   #### e. **Null**
   - Represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is often used to denote “no value” or “empty.”
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     let y = null;
     ```

   #### f. **Symbol (ES6)**
   - Represents a unique and immutable value, often used as object property keys to avoid conflicts.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     let symbol = Symbol('id');
     ```

   #### g. **BigInt (ES11)**
   - Used to represent integers that are larger than the `Number` type can handle (above 2^53).
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     let largeNumber = BigInt(12345678901234567890);
     ```

### 2. **Reference Data Types**
   Reference types are objects that store multiple values. These are mutable, meaning their values can change after creation.

   #### a. **Object**
   - Objects are collections of key-value pairs. Each key (also called a property) is a string or symbol, and the value can be any data type.
   - Objects are used to represent real-world entities and store related data.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     let person = {
       name: "John",
       age: 30,
       isMarried: false
     };
     console.log(person.name); // Output: John
     ```

   #### b. **Array**
   - Arrays are ordered collections of values (elements). Elements can be of any type (strings, numbers, objects, etc.).
   - Arrays are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index `0`.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
     console.log(fruits[1]); // Output: banana
     fruits.push('mango'); // Adds 'mango' to the array
     ```

   #### c. **Function**
   - Functions are also considered objects in JavaScript. They can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, or returned from other functions.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     function greet() {
       return "Hello";
     }
     let sayHello = greet;
     console.log(sayHello()); // Output: Hello
     ```

### 3. **Special Data Types**

   #### a. **Array**
   - Arrays are a type of object used for storing lists of values.
   - Arrays have various methods, such as `.push()`, `.pop()`, `.map()`, and `.filter()`.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
     let doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
     console.log(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
     ```

   #### b. **Date**
   - JavaScript has a built-in `Date` object to handle dates and times.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     let today = new Date();
     console.log(today.toDateString()); // Output: Current date in string form
     ```

   #### c. **Set**
   - A collection of unique values.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     let set = new Set([1, 2, 3, 3, 4]);
     console.log(set); // Output: Set { 1, 2, 3, 4 }
     ```

   #### d. **Map**
   - A `Map` is a collection of key-value pairs where both the keys and values can be of any type.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     let map = new Map();
     map.set('name', 'John');
     console.log(map.get('name')); // Output: John
     ```

### **Type Checking**
   To check the type of a variable, you can use the `typeof` operator.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     console.log(typeof "hello");   // Output: string
     console.log(typeof 123);       // Output: number
     console.log(typeof true);      // Output: boolean
     console.log(typeof []);        // Output: object (arrays are objects)
     console.log(typeof null);      // Output: object (this is an oddity in JavaScript)
     ```

### Summary:
- **Primitive Types**: String, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol, BigInt
- **Reference Types**: Object, Array, Function, Map, Set

These data types are foundational to working effectively in JavaScript, and each has its unique properties and use cases.
